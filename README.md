# Census-Project
Every ten years, the United Kingdom undertakes a census of the population, with the most recent one  having been conducted in 2021. The purpose of the census is to compare different people across the  nation, to provide the government with accurate statistics of the population to enable better planning, to  develop policies, and to allocate appropriate funding.
